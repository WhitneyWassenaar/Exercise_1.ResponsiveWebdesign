In the afternoon I started following the tutorial about building my first website. I already knew a lot about the basics of HTML and CSS. But when I moved to JavaScript I went in to a bit of trouble. The code on the website of MDN did not work on my website and I didn't know what was causing this. Then after a while I saw that there was a difference in declaration between the codes. I still haven't figured how JavaScript actually works. I made comments in my code to remind myself what I was thinking at that moment or writing down notes or questions to not forget important info.

But first I would like to dive into responsive webdesign. That's a skill I want to master before moving on to JavaScript.
